## üéØ Project Overview

This project tackles two critical business problems for British Airways:

1. **Lounge Demand Forecasting**: Creating a scalable lookup table to estimate lounge eligibility across different flight groupings
2. **Customer Booking Prediction**: Building a machine learning model to predict booking completion with business-optimized thresholds

---

## üíº Business Context

### Problem Statement

British Airways needs to:
- **Plan lounge capacity** at Heathrow Terminal 3 without exact flight details
- **Predict customer bookings** to optimize marketing spend and maximize revenue
- **Balance precision vs recall** based on real business costs (¬£1,000 revenue per booking, ¬£10 marketing cost)

### Why This Matters

- Lounge overcrowding damages premium customer experience
- Poor booking predictions lead to either wasted marketing spend or missed revenue
- Business decisions require interpretable, calibrated models

---

## üìä Task 1: Lounge Demand Modeling

### Objective
Create a generalized lookup table estimating lounge eligibility percentages without relying on specific flight numbers or aircraft types.

### Approach

**Grouping Strategy:**
- **Time of Day**: Morning, Lunchtime, Afternoon, Evening
- **Haul Type**: Long-haul (outside Europe) vs Short-haul (within Europe)

**Rationale:**
- Scalable to future schedules
- Reflects actual customer behavior patterns
- Simple enough for operational teams to use

### Key Findings

| Tier | Percentage | Strategic Implication |
|------|-----------|----------------------|
| **Tier 3 (Club Lounge)** | 78% | Requires maximum scalability and space |
| **Tier 2 (First Lounge)** | 20% | Focus on service quality for business travelers |
| **Tier 1 (Concorde Room)** | 1-2% | Premium experience, small but critical segment |

**Critical Insight**: Distribution is remarkably stable across time of day and haul type, which simplifies capacity planning significantly.

### Deliverables

‚úÖ Lookup table with tier percentages by flight grouping  
‚úÖ Justification document explaining grouping choices  
‚úÖ Visualizations showing eligibility patterns  
‚úÖ Actionable recommendations for lounge investments

## ü§ñ Task 2: Predictive Booking Model

### The Challenge

**Dataset**: 5,000 customer booking records  
**Class Distribution**: 85% no booking, 15% booking complete  
**Key Challenge**: Severe class imbalance makes traditional accuracy metrics misleading

### Exploratory Data Analysis

#### Feature Analysis Summary

**Numerical Features:**
- Purchase lead time, length of stay, flight hour/duration, number of passengers
- Applied distribution analysis, skewness testing, and Q-Q plots

**Categorical Features:**
- Sales channel, trip type, booking origin (104 countries), route (799 unique), flight day
- Evaluated using chi-square tests, Cram√©r's V, and mutual information

**Binary Features:**
- Extra baggage, preferred seat, in-flight meal selections

#### Feature Selection Decisions

| Feature | Decision | Rationale |
|---------|----------|-----------|
| `booking_origin` | ‚úÖ **KEEP** | Top 10 origins cover 91% of data, MI = 0.061 |
| `route` | ‚ùå **DROP** | 799 categories, 73% have <50 samples, excessive noise |
| `flight_day` | ‚ùå **DROP** | MI ‚âà 0, only 2% booking rate variation |
| `purchase_lead` | ‚ùå **DROP** | Weak signal despite multiple transformation attempts |
| Binary features | ‚ùå **DROP** | All showed MI < 0.005, driven by necessity not intent |

### Feature Engineering

#### Encoding Strategies

**Low-Cardinality Features:**
- Label encoding for `sales_channel`, `trip_type`

**High-Cardinality Features:**
- Frequency encoding for `booking_origin`, `route`
- Out-of-Fold (OOF) smoothed target encoding for `booking_origin`
  - Smoothing parameter k=10 to regularize rare categories
  - Prevents data leakage through proper CV splits

**Temporal Features:**
- Cyclical encoding for `flight_day` and `flight_hour`
- Sine/cosine transformations to preserve periodicity
- Ensures hour 23 is mathematically close to hour 0

**Numerical Features:**
- Winsorization at 1st/99th percentile for outlier handling
- Preserves data while reducing extreme value influence

#### Interaction Features

Created meaningful interactions to capture complex patterns:
- `fhourbucket_x_routefreq`: Flight timing √ó route popularity
- `lenstay_x_fduration`: Stay length √ó flight duration
- `originTE_x_fhourbucket`: Geographic √ó temporal patterns

### Modeling Approach

#### Models Evaluated

| Model | Configuration | Purpose |
|-------|--------------|---------|
| **Random Forest (Baseline)** | `class_weight='balanced'` | Establish baseline, feature importance |
| **Random Forest + SMOTE** | Oversampling minority class | Test synthetic data approach |
| **XGBoost** | `scale_pos_weight=5.69` | Production model with better performance |
| **Stacked Ensemble** | XGBoost + base predictions | Final optimized model |

#### Handling Class Imbalance

**Techniques Evaluated:**

1. **SMOTE** (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling)
   - Result: Minimal improvement, slight AUC drop (0.75 ‚Üí 0.738)
   - Decision: ‚ùå Not adopted

2. **Class Weights**
   - Implementation: `class_weight='balanced'` (RF), `scale_pos_weight` (XGBoost)
   - Result: ‚úÖ Stable performance without synthetic data complications
   - Decision: ‚úÖ Adopted

3. **Threshold Tuning**
   - Result: ‚úÖ Critical for business optimization
   - Decision: ‚úÖ Primary strategy for production deployment

### Model Performance

#### Cross-Validation Results

**5-Fold Stratified Cross-Validation:**
- Individual models saved as `xgb_fold1.pkl` through `xgb_fold5.pkl`
- Ensemble predictions from all folds used for final evaluation

**Test Set Metrics:**

| Metric | Score | Interpretation |
|--------|-------|----------------|
| **ROC-AUC** | 0.766 | Strong discriminative power; good separation between bookers and non-bookers |
| **Accuracy** | 0.70 | Balanced overall performance despite 15% class imbalance |
| **Recall (Positive Class)** | 0.71 | High ability to capture actual bookers - crucial for revenue potential |
| **Precision (Positive Class)** | 0.29 | Lower due to class imbalance; acceptable given priority on Recall |
| **Brier Score** | 0.112 | Excellent probability calibration; scores reliably reflect true likelihood |

#### Strategic Justification

**Why prioritize Recall over Precision?**

The business cost of missing a potential booker is higher than the cost of occasionally targeting a non-booker. A 71% Recall ensures we identify the vast majority of high-value conversion opportunities, maximizing revenue potential despite moderate precision.

#### Feature Importance (SHAP Analysis)

**Top 5 Predictive Drivers:**

| Rank | Feature | Importance | Business Insight |
|------|---------|-----------|------------------|
| 1 | **Booking Origin TE** | Highest | Geographic conversion rates - historical booking patterns by origin strongly predict likelihood |
| 2 | **Booking Origin Frequency** | High | High-traffic origins indicate established demand and higher booking propensity |
| 3 | **Flight Duration (Medium)** | Medium | Non-extreme flight durations (medium-haul) show optimal conversion rates vs very short or very long flights |
| 4 | **Length of Stay (Winsorized)** | Medium | Longer planned stays indicate higher commitment level, increasing booking odds |
| 5 | **Stay √ó Flight Duration Interaction** | Medium | Nonlinear interaction captures nuanced booking behavior - the relationship between trip length and flight time reveals complex customer intent |

**Key Finding**: The model effectively identifies booking patterns driven by **origin market conversion history** and **customer travel parameters** (duration, stay length), providing clear levers for marketing and conversion strategy optimization.

**Calibration Quality**: The reliability plot shows the model follows perfect calibration closely, with predicted probabilities reliably reflecting actual booking likelihoods across all probability ranges.

### Model Calibration

Comprehensive calibration analysis across multiple methods:

| Method | Brier Score | ECE | Assessment |
|--------|-------------|-----|------------|
| Raw Model | 0.1120 | 0.0109 | Excellent - already well calibrated |
| Platt Scaling | 0.1119 | 0.0041 | Undesired sharp probability drops |
| Temperature Scaling | 0.1120 | 0.0106 | T=1 indicates no adjustment needed |
| Isotonic Regression | 0.1115 | 0.0000 | Marginal gain but potential overfitting |

**Decision**: Deploy raw model - probabilities are already reliable for business decisions.

### Business-Optimized Threshold Selection

#### Strategic Goal

**Primary Objective**: Identify high-potential bookers early in the funnel to enable highly actionable and profitable targeted engagement.

#### Model Target

**What We're Predicting**: The probability that an individual customer will proceed to complete a booking transaction.

**Why This Matters**: Early identification allows for:
- Personalized marketing interventions
- Resource allocation optimization
- Proactive customer engagement strategies

#### Algorithm & Training

- **Model**: XGBoost (Regularized + CV)
- **Training Data**: 40,000 samples
- **Class Distribution**: 15% positive (booking completion)
- **Validation**: 5-Fold Stratified Cross-Validation with saved models per fold

#### Performance at Business-Optimal Threshold

The threshold was selected to **maximize recall** while maintaining acceptable precision, reflecting the business reality that missing a potential booking is significantly more costly than occasional false positives.

**Strategic Justification**: 
- 71% Recall ensures we identify the vast majority of high-value conversion opportunities
- Moderate precision (29%) is acceptable given the low cost of targeting non-converters relative to missing actual bookers
- This strategy maximizes total revenue potential over false positive minimization

## üí° Key Learnings

### What Worked

‚úÖ **OOF Target Encoding**: Properly implemented CV-safe encoding prevented leakage while regularizing rare categories  
‚úÖ **Business-First Optimization**: Threshold tuning based on real costs significantly outperformed generic metric optimization  
‚úÖ **Feature Selection Discipline**: Removing weak features (`wants_*`, `purchase_lead`) improved model stability  
‚úÖ **Calibration Focus**: Well-calibrated probabilities enabled confident threshold decisions  

### What Didn't Work

‚ùå **SMOTE**: Added noise rather than signal, decreased overall performance  
‚ùå **Over-Engineering `purchase_lead`**: Multiple transformations and interactions showed no improvement  
‚ùå **Default Thresholds**: Standard 0.5 threshold completely missed business objectives  
‚ùå **Binary Add-on Features**: Customer extras (meals, bags, seats) showed almost zero predictive power  

### Surprising Findings

üí° **Geographic Dominance**: 44% of model power from booking origin alone - far stronger than expected  
üí° **Stable Tier Distribution**: Lounge eligibility barely varies by time/haul (simplifies planning dramatically)  
üí° **Purchase Lead Weakness**: Booking lead time showed minimal signal despite strong business intuition  
üí° **Calibration Quality**: Model achieved excellent calibration without explicit calibration techniques
